# Slideshow
*Pitch Week 1, Due Week 3*

## Tool 
+ [Bootstrap Carousel](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#carousel)

## Notes
We aren't going to learn more HTML than we need to create the slideshows -- we'll be using a lot of tempates this semester so we can focus on storytelling and really finish stories while we get the basics down. Check out the HTML/CSS module if you want to expand your HTML and CSS skills, or consider taking Data Viz next semester, where we'll build on all of these skills. 

Our goal here is to get folks to a place where they can put some photos with captions in a Bootstrap carousel and upload it to Digital Storage, and then focus on writing good captions that tell a story. Less "this picture shows," more

## Examples of the Form

### Great Captions (or just good ones)
+ Nothing special, but this is what we're looking for: <http://www.npr.org/2014/04/03/298800950/student-debt-weighs-down-women-more-blame-the-wage-gap> Use words to tell us what the photo can't. Let the photo speak for itself.
+ Again, the captions add to the images, they don't tell us what is in the image.[Life below the poverty line in Troy, NY](http://www.slate.com/blogs/behold/2014/07/17/brenda_ann_kenneally_documents_life_below_the_poverty_line_in_troy_york.html)
+ [After Recession, More Young Adults Are Living on Street](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/19/us/since-recession-more-young-americans-are-homeless.html)

### Slideshows
+ NPR's [2013 Best Music](http://www.npr.org/blogs/bestmusic2013/2013/12/10/249243871/npr-musics-50-favorite-albums-of-2013) roundup isn't a true slide show, but it follows the basic format. 
+ Graphic slide set from Boston Marathon bombing. No captions. [View](http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/specials/boston-marathon-explosions)
+ [Obesity in China](http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2014/07/18/world/asia/20140718_obese_now.html) chosen more or less at random from NY Times. 
+ NYT's Well Blog profiled [children living with cancer](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/05/19/health/healthguide/childhood-cancer.html)
+ [Two Men, One Sky](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/sports/two-men-one-sky-the-silent-realization-of-a-purer-form-of-flight.html) is part of a larger package. I don't love the captions, but it is good for diversity. 
+ [Ayodhya in Pictures: Chapter One] (http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887323751104578148612516129072?)
+ [Tsunami Photos](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/worldnews/9131914/Japan-earthquake-and-tsunami-anniversary-30-powerful-images-of-the-disaster.html)

### More complicated stuff
+ More complex [timeline based slide show from ABC](http://abcnews.go.com/US/fullpage/boston-marathon-bombing-interactive-timeline-abcnews-189975400)
+ Slightly wonky Detroit Free Press [interactive](http://www.freep.com/interactive/article/20130415/NEWS07/304150201/boston-marathon-bombing-map) on the bombing.

+ A [Firestorm in Tasmania](http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/may/26/firestorm-bushfire-dunalley-holmes-family)
