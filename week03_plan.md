## Slideshows

* Double check that your images are there and they're where the server is looking; remember that your computer is not case sensitive but the server is.

* Check your work online -- if you send me a URL and I see a slideshow that doesn't work it is hard for me to know what to do with it. I need you to tell me that you know there's a problem. 

* Make sure you have as many indicators as you have slides. That isn't automatic 

* Filezilla is the USPS, carrying messages from you to grandma. You don't put things on Filezilla any more than you send a letter to the mailman. You send the letter to Grandma, USPS delivers it. 

* Make the photos a consistent size. 

* Think about story arc -- how can we introduce this story? Why does this matter? 

## In groups of three 

* Look over each others slide shows -- do they make sense? Can you come to it without an explanation and understand why you're seeing what you see?

## Map Pitches

* A lot of you are going to want or need to scale these back, at least for the first pass.
