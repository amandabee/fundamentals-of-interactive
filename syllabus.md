**Course objectives**  
This ten week module will introduce you to a variety of interactive storytelling forms and will combine storytelling skills, especially creating content appropriate to the form, with fundamental technical skills that will serve as the foundation for your interactive work at the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism.

**Course outcomes**  
Students will leave this module with experience:  

+ Writing a basic HTML page
+ Using an FTP client to publish content online
+ Incorporating external javascript libraries to create basic interactions
+ Crafting good questions to ensure they get useful technical assistance when they need it
+ Creating basic maps and charts that convey information clearly
+ Reporting and producing stories with data and interactivity

Students will also have experience telling meaningful and complete stories in interactive formats where space is at a premium.

## Story Guidelines
Your work for this class should be your own original reporting. However, if you've done reporting for another class that you'd like to expand on in an interactive project, we encourage you to return to stories you know well. 

We're going to cover five forms that we think touch on a range of skills you can use throughout your career. If you want to build on these, take newsgames or data visualization or take advantage of coaching to incorporate these into your stories in other classes.

Every story you produce for our class should include clear source information for any data or images that you did not produce yourself. 

### Specific Story Requirements

+ **Slideshow**: your slideshow should include six to ten different images with captions. Each caption should be 20 to 100 words. 
+ **Image Map**: your image map should include one image or a collage of several images with at least five annotations. Each annotation should be less than 50 words. 
+ **Map**: your map can be a map of points or shapes, but should include a clear, thoughtful title and a caption that tells us why we're looking at this map. Your caption should be between 50 and 150 words. 
+ **Quiz**: your quiz should include four to six questions with two to four possible answers each. 
+ **Chart**: your chart assignment should use data with news interest and inlude a title and caption that direct readers to a clear takeaway (which is to say, they should know why they are looking at this chart)

Remember: titles and captions are part of your story. Work is not complete without them. 

## About the Faculty

**Amanda Hickman** works at the intersection of journalism and civic engagement, and especially values reporting that makes it easier for individuals to participate in democratic processes. As program director at DocumentCloud, she helped reporters around the world analyze, annotate, and publish primary source documents. Amanda managed development of a series of games about public policy issues as Gotham Gazette‘s director of technology. She has spent more than a decade reporting on local and international events and working directly with community based organizations to understand, and draw their membership into, the political process. Amanda has taught at Columbia Graduate School of Journalism, NYU’s Gallatin School and CUNY Graduate School of Journalism.

## Plagiarism and Copyright

It is a serious ethical violation to take any material created by another person and represent it as your own original work. Any such plagiarism will result in serious disciplinary action, possibly including dismissal from the CUNY J-School. *Plagiarism* may involve copying text from a book or magazine without attributing the source, or lifting words, code, photographs, videos, or other materials from the Internet and attempting to pass them off as your own. Please ask the instructor if you have any questions about how to distinguish between acceptable research and plagiarism.

In addition to being a serious academic issue, *copyright* is a serious legal issue.

Never "lift" or "borrow" or "appropriate" or "repurpose" graphics, audio, or code without both permission and attribution. This applies to scripts, audio, video clips, programs, photos, drawings, and other images, and it includes images found online and in books.

Create your own graphics, seek out images that are in the public domain or shared via a creative commons license that allows derivative works, or use images from the AP Photo Bank or which the school has obtained licensing.

If you’re repurposing code, be sure to keep the original licensing intact. If you’re not sure how to credit code, ask.

The exception to this rule is fair use: if your story is about the image itself, it is often acceptable to reproduce the image. If you want to better understand fair use, the [Citizen Media Law Project](http://www.citmedialaw.org/legal-guide) is an excellent resource. </a>

When in doubt: ask.

## Deadlines

Deadlines are real: we plan lessons around the assumption that you will have pitches to workshop when pitches are due. If you don't, it disrupts the whole class. So deadlines should not be missed without exceptionally good reason, and your instructor should always be notified in advance. 

If you're stumped or stuck or worried that you are falling behind, talk to me. I can help get you caught up and unstuck.

## Absences and Tardiness

Participation and attendance required and are important to your success in the class.

Please be on time for class and back to class from breaks. Repeated tardiness will result in a reduction of grade in participation.

# Week by Week
## Week 0

Before class ... please come week 1 with Filezilla, TextWrangler and Mou installed on your computer. All three are available free of charge. 

## Week 1
Welcome. 

Story form lecture: Slideshows and what makes them work. 
Pre-pitch possible slideshows. 

**Hands-on:** make a basic HTML page in bootstrap and upload it to Digital Storage.

## Week 2
*Due:* Slideshow pitches, URL for HTML excercise.

Story meeting: who has ideas for stories down the line? Are they interesting? What would make them interesting. You should be looking ahead. 

Story form lecture: Imagemaps, annotations -- adding exploration to an image. Look at 

**Hands on:** Adding jQuery to a Bootstrap Page, putting an image map together in JSFiddle


## Week 3
*Due:* Draft of slideshow, Annotation pitches

Story meeting: who has ideas for stories down the line? Are they interesting? What would make them interesting. You should be looking ahead. 

Story form lecture: maps and mapping

**Hands on:** Moving your image map from JSFiddle to an HTML page; pivot tables to summarize data (use 311 call data)

**Homework** Pivot 311 calls by community board

## Week 4
*Due:* Draft Annotation, map pitches, 311 pivot table

**Hands on:** Making a map in CartoDB (using 311 call data).

## Week 5

*Due:* Draft map, quiz pitches

**Hands on:** Everyone pick your favorite stat out of [Stats and the City](http://mycrains.crainsnewyork.com/stats-and-the-city/boroughs) and we'll make a quiz about the city using the Mother Jones framework. 

Story form lecture: chart-based stories

## Week 6

**Discussion:** what stands out in the slideshows from week 3?

**Hands on:** Starting a chart in JS Fiddle; Mr Data Converter

## Week 7

*Due:* Draft chart, Slideshow revision

**Discussion:** what stands out in the annotations from week 4?

**Hands on:** Troubleshooting chart problems, customizing charts -- look at how NYT really cuts down the cruft but still tells you what the charts mean. How can we incorporate that?

## Week 8

*Due:* Annotation revision

**Discussion:** Maps from week 5, what would make those stronger? 

**Hands on:** Troubleshooting map problems?
