## About the Faculty

**Amanda Hickman** works at the intersection of journalism and civic engagement, and especially values reporting that makes it easier for individuals to participate in democratic processes. As program director at DocumentCloud, she helped reporters around the world analyze, annotate, and publish primary source documents. Amanda managed development of a series of games about public policy issues as Gotham Gazette‘s director of technology. She has spent more than a decade reporting on local and international events and working directly with community based organizations to understand, and draw their membership into, the political process. Amanda has taught at Columbia Graduate School of Journalism, NYU’s Gallatin School and CUNY Graduate School of Journalism.

## Plagiarism and Copyright

It is a serious ethical violation to take any material created by another person and represent it as your own original work. Any such plagiarism will result in serious disciplinary action, possibly including dismissal from the CUNY J-School. *Plagiarism* may involve copying text from a book or magazine without attributing the source, or lifting words, code, photographs, videos, or other materials from the Internet and attempting to pass them off as your own. Please ask the instructor if you have any questions about how to distinguish between acceptable research and plagiarism.

In addition to being a serious academic issue, *copyright* is a serious legal issue.

Never "lift" or "borrow" or "appropriate" or "repurpose" graphics, audio, or code without both permission and attribution. This applies to scripts, audio, video clips, programs, photos, drawings, and other images, and it includes images found online and in books.

Create your own graphics, seek out images that are in the public domain or shared via a creative commons license that allows derivative works, or use images from the AP Photo Bank or which the school has obtained licensing.

If you’re repurposing code, be sure to keep the original licensing intact. If you’re not sure how to credit code, ask.

The exception to this rule is fair use: if your story is about the image itself, it is often acceptable to reproduce the image. If you want to better understand fair use, the [Citizen Media Law Project](http://www.citmedialaw.org/legal-guide) is an excellent resource. </a>

When in doubt: ask.

## Deadlines

Deadlines are real: we plan lessons around the assumption that you will have pitches to workshop when pitches are due. If you don't, it disrupts the whole class. So deadlines should not be missed without exceptionally good reason, and I should always be notified in advance. 

The exception: you will be handing in a handful of exercises this semester, follow up work on spreadsheet skills, CartoDB, Open Refine, jQuery and HighCharts -- these are all described as "exercises" in the syllabus. Everyone gets one pass on these deadlines. As long as I have the exercise within a week of the original due date, I won't hold it against you. But you only get to do that once.

If you're stumped or stuck or worried that you are falling behind, talk to me. I can help get you caught up and unstuck.

## Absences and Tardiness

Participation and attendance required and are important to your success in the class.

Please be on time for class and back to class from breaks. Repeated tardiness will result in a reduction of grade in participation.

# Story Guidelines
Your work for this class should be your own original reporting. However, if you've done reporting for another class that you'd like to expand on in an interactive project, we encourage you to return to stories you know well. 

We're going to cover five forms that we think touch on a range of skills you can use throughout your career. If you want to build on these, take newsgames or data visualization or take advantage of coaching to incorporate these into your stories in other classes.

# Software Requirements
+ Filezilla
+ TextWrangler
+ Mou

# Online Accounts
+ GIS.stackexchange.com
+ CartoDB (make sure you are getting a  discounted academic account. The regular free account IS NOT ADEQUATE.)
+ JSFiddle
+ GitHub


# Additional Course Goals

Students need the skills to put their portfolios together. Can we get Career Svcs or an IT Brownbag for this? 

# Week by Week
## Week 0

Before class ... please come week 1 with Filezilla, TextWrangler and Mou installed on your computer. All three are available free of charge. 

## Week 1
Welcome. 

Story form lecture: Slideshows and what makes them work. 
Pre-pitch possible slideshows. 

**Hands-on:** make a basic HTML page in bootstrap and upload it to Digital Storage.

**Homework** make a new page. Use 2-3 paragraph tags and an anchored link to tell me what community board you're covering and what kind of stories you want to write this semester. Do you have loose ideas for stories? What are they? 

## Week 2
*Due:* Slideshow pitches, URL for HTML excercise.

Story meeting: who has ideas for stories down the line? Are they interesting? What would make them interesting. You should be looking ahead. 

Story form lecture: Imagemaps, annotations -- adding exploration to an image. Look at 

**Hands on:** Adding jQuery to a Bootstrap Page, putting an image map together in JSFiddle


## Week 3
*Due:* Draft of slideshow, Annotation pitches

Story meeting: who has ideas for stories down the line? Are they interesting? What would make them interesting. You should be looking ahead. 

Story form lecture: maps and mapping

**Hands on:** Moving your image map from JSFiddle to an HTML page; pivot tables to summarize data (use 311 call data)

**Homework** Pivot 311 calls by community board

## Week 4
*Due:* Draft Annotation, map pitches, 311 pivot table

**Hands on:** Making a map in CartoDB (using 311 call data).

Story form lecture: quizzes and telling a story in a quiz.

## Week 5

*Due:* Draft map, quiz pitches

**Hands on:** Everyone pick your favorite stat out of [Stats and the City](http://mycrains.crainsnewyork.com/stats-and-the-city/boroughs) and we'll make a quiz about the city using the Mother Jones framework.

## Week 6

*Due:* Draft quiz (Spreadsheet URL and Digital Storage URL), chart pitches

**Discussion:** what stands out in the slideshows from week 3?

**Hands on:** Starting a chart in JS Fiddle; Mr Data Converter

## Week 7

*Due:* Draft chart, Slideshow revision

**Discussion:** what stands out in the annotations from week 4?

**Hands on:** Troubleshooting chart problems, customizing charts -- look at how NYT really cuts down the cruft but still tells you what the charts mean. How can we incorporate that?

## Week 8

*Due:* Annotation revision

**Discussion:** Maps from week 5, what would make those stronger? 

**Hands on:** Troubleshooting map problems?


## Week 9
