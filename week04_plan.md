# Week 9 Plan

## Map Notes

We had some good questions about how quintiles differ from equal intervals so I wanted to mock up the difference.

one clunky example: <http://www.ncgia.ucsb.edu/cctp/units/unit47/html/quanteq.html>
In the first map, the groups are the same size. All the counties where 1-13% of residents live on active farms are light blue. All the counties where 40-52% live on active farms are bright blue. As a result, two counties stand out as having a very high proportion of folks living on active farms. 
In the second map, there are the same number of counties in each map, and it comes out looking very dfferent.

Today I want to spend a good amount of time on maps, and then look at some quiz examples and talk about what makes those work. Next week, I want your maps embedded on an HTML page. And the following week, we'll have quizzes.

> Fake blood was squirted on to the Marine Transfer Station sign by protesters after police left ... 

The protesters squirted fake blood. Not only is that tighter, it is direct. 

## Map review 

+ difference between points and shapes
+ categories vs continuums


## Quizzes

A newsquiz should move the story along. Don't just ding people for getting the answer wrong, tell them why it is wrong -- give them a little something to go on as they try again (and let them try again). And don't just reward people for getting the answer right -- tell them *why* it is the right answer. We're not here to grade your knowledge of the story, we're trying to make you think this story is interesting. 

+ what are we looking for
+ telling a story and being playful

(Maybe; maybe push this to next week)
