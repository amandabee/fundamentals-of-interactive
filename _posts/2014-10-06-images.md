You don't have to use your own photos for every image in your slideshow. As long as you have permission to reuse someone else's image, you're welcome to include it. I don't want more than half the photos in your slideshow to come from someone else, however.

If you're looking for archival photos or other images, take a look at my data viz resource page for some great suggestions:

### Adding images to the page

Use an [`<img...>`](http://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/Elements/img) tag to add images to your page. The tag requires a `src` attribute to work, and I also require you to include an `alt` attribute. A `title` is also good form. Sample code:

`<img src="path/to/image.jpg" alt="This text appears or is read to people who cannot view images for some reason." title="This text displays when you hover over the image. And it gets indexed by search engines." />`

Note that in this example, your browser is going to be looking for a folder called "path" in the same folder as your HTML page. And it is going to be looking inside of "path" for a folder called "to", and then inside *that* folder for a file called "image.jpg" -- if the image isn't there or the paths don't match, the image won't appear.

Just to keep you on your toes, it is up to the server (or the server administrator, really) to decide whether capitalization matters. And on Digital Storage, it does matter. On most OSX computers, it does not. So calling your images folder `Images` will work fine when you view the file locally (at that `file:///Users...` URL) but break when you try to access it on Digital Storage (at `http://digitalstorage.journalism.cuny.edu/yourname...` URL). So stick with lowercase file names for your own sanity!
