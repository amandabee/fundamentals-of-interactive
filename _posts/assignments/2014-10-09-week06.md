This week you're going to make a new HTML page and upload it to Digital Storage, and bring in one pitch for a slideshow. 

## Make a new page

Use the basic bootstrap template to make a new html page called `week6.html`. On the page, use 2-3 `<p>...</p>` paragraph tags and at least one anchored link `<a href="">...</a>` to tell me what community board you are covering this semester and what kind of stories you hope to write, in general. If you have any ideas for interactive projects, go ahead and tell me about those as well. 

Upload your html page to digital storage, double check it, and send me the URL. If it doesn't start with `http://digitalstorage.journalism.cuny.edu` you're doing something wrong. 

## Pitch your slideshow

You're going to use the Bootstrap carousel to create a slideshow of six to ten different images. Each one should have a caption of 20-100 words. Think about photos you've already taken this semester, or photos you know you're going to need for another project. In 150-300 words, tell me what you want to include in your photo slide show, why it is interesting and why it is newsworthy. Please also let me know whether you plan to take new photos or re-use photos or outtakes from another assignment. 

Your work for this class should be your own original reporting. However, if you've done reporting for another class that you'd like to expand on in an interactive project, we encourage you to return to stories you know well. 

Every story you produce for our class should include clear source information for any data or images that you did not produce yourself.
