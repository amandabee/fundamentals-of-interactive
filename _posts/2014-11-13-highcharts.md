+ the [Highcharts Demo](http://www.highcharts.com/demo/) page in a browser (we'll start with a basic line chart)   
+ our [sample data on Bronx graduation rates](https://raw.github.com/amandabee/cunyjdata/master/assignments/graduation_outcomes.csv) in a text editor or spreadsheet program   
+ your text editor (if you don't have one, try [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/) or [Text Wrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/TextWrangler/), or if you're feeling fancy and want free and open source software, try [Emacs](http://emacsformacosx.com/) or [Vim](http://macvim.org/OSX/index.php))   
+ [Mr Data Converter](http://shancarter.com/data_converter/) in a browser   

*I'll add more notes when we're done with HighCharts today.*
