This week you're going to finish your CartoDB map, revise your Quiz pitch and start thinking about chart stories. 

### Maps

Embed your CartoDB map on an html page named `map_draft.html` and upload it to digital storage. Email me the URL.

Your map page should include:

+ a headline
+ a caption (below the headline is fine) of not more than 200 words that puts the map in context
+ a map
+ a legend
+ clear attribution for your data

### Quiz Pitches

Please also take a second look at your quiz pitch -- you don't have to revise your proposal if the class discussion didn't inspire you to take a new tack, but please do make sure it is up at `quiz_pitch.html` and includes at least two potential questions and answers. I'd love it if you included five or six questions and answers. 

Again, email me the URL. 

### Chart Stories

Please give some thought to data that you'd like to pursue in a non-map form, and come to class next week prepared to discuss a few ideas. We'll talk a bit about what we're looking for and you'll have a chance to refine your ideas and pitch me a chart for the following week.
