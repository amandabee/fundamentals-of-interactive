This week you're going to embed your CartoDB map on an html page named `map_draft.html` and upload it to digital storage. Email me the URL.

You also need to revise your Quiz pitch and write up two or three sample questions and answers. You can update your `quiz_pitch.html` with those revisions (or create the page if you haven't already). Again, email me the URL.
