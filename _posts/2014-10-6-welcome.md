My syllabus, and most of the material's you'll
need for class live at:

<http://amandabee.github.io/fundamentals-of-interactive/>

Before we meet, please take a moment to install ...

+ [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/)
+ [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/)
+ [Mou](http://25.io/mou/)

...on your laptop. We'll be using all three in class. They're all available free of charge.

I also encourage you to read <http://www.niemanlab.org/2013/12/scooped-by-code/> to give some context to the next ten weeks.
