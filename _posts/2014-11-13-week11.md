+ Chart drafts. Get your chart working in JS Fiddle and add the URL to the [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WivcUXhWp-kmdU8iz8Du7alwP12VN2LSgygBz7s0PBs/edit#heading=h.chcx9p8eauut). We'll embed it on an HTML page in class next week. 

+ Slideshow Revisions. Focus on content, get your pictures resized, make sure you tell a story. Next week we'll work on some CSS. Use `slideshow_revised.html` as your filename.  
    + Take another pass at your title: does it capture something about why we're looking at these photos?
    + Are all of your photos resized? They shouldn't be larger than 1140
pixels wide.
    +  Do the indicator dots all work? Test them. Are they all there?
    +  Are your individual photo captions in full sentences? Are they consistent? If you started a quote, does it end?
    + If some of your photos also have a title and others don't, decide which you're going for and make sure that all or none have titles. I don't care whether your titles are in Title Case or sentence case, but they need to be consistent.
