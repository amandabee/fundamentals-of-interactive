# Map
*Pitch Week 3, Due Week 5*

## Tool
CartoDB -- be sure to use the right URL to get the free Academic plan.

We're making fairly basic maps. The data visualization class will give you an opportunity to really refine your maps.

## Student Checklist
[] Register for CartoDB (Use the right URL!)
[] Sign up for GIS Stack exchange

## Technical Skills
+ Making an HTML Template (Story 1)
+ Basic Bootstrap (Story 1)
+ FTP and File Management (Story 1)
+ Understanding points and polygons
+ Basic SQL Join and Select
+ Embedding your map on an HTML page
+ Asking good questions

## Hands On

Lookup and download ...

+ One month of 311 calls; pivot by community board
+ Community board boundary files

Upload both to CartoDB and join them. What is the most common call category in your CD? Customize your map by that. 

SQL is just grammar. You have a series of verbs: SELECT, UPDATE. There's precision to it, for better or for worse. 

## Takeaway concepts
You have to have some kind of geography. Either you have to geocode content or merge it with a file that has geographic boundaries. You can make mapping incredibly complex. We're going to stay small this semester.
