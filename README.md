Fundamentals of Interactive
============

If you're making edits in a local copy of the repository (as opposed to on the site) I highly recommend [Mou](http://mouapp.com/) for editing Markdown.

We have ten weeks and want to cover five basic story forms in those weeks. Right now, we just have a single page devoted to each. As we start to break out lesson plans and hands on activities, I will probably need to reorganize somewhat. But ... for each story form, I've included (or am pulling together now) a few key elements:

+ Tool -- the tool we're expecting everyone to use. If you feel strongly about using an alternative, open an issue and we'll work it out. 
+ Technical Skills -- these roughly correspond to lesson plans that are forthcoming or already in place. In many cases we're pulling a lesson plan from [Data Viz](https://github.com/amandabee/cunyjdata) and modifying it. 
+ Examples of the Form -- I want to find a good mix of examples that are well within their capacity now, and things that are way more than you can just hammer out in a week. So, some "wheelhouse" and some "inpsiration"
+ Hands On -- loose, rough lesson plans to expand on. 


You can rearrange the schedule if it makes sense to you to do things differently. Quizzes before maps or maps before quizzes is no big deal. You can also rearrange deadlines if you'd rather have folks work through a form and then move on instead of coming back to do edits. 

One of our goals is for every student to have roughly the same technical foundation by the end of the semester so we do need to work in tandem.
