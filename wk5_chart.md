#Charts

*Pitch Week 5, Due Week 7*


## Examples of the Form 
+ WAMU [In Fight For Deals, Developers Make Well-Timed Campaign Contributions ](http://wamu.org/news/13/05/23/timing_of_campaign_contributions_examined) -- not chart driven, but the chart is a nice example of a simple, clean chart that helps tell the story.
+ Miami Herald [Tracking the Hunger Strike](http://www.miamiherald.com/static/media/projects/gitmo_chart/) is an example of a more advanced chart-based story. 
+ NPR [Zoom In On Oklahoma Tornado Damage](http://apps.npr.org/moore-oklahoma-tornado-damage/)
