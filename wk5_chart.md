## Lecture Notes
Start with the basics -- how does shifting the yAxis distort a chart, lines are continuous so the data they encode should be continuous. Look at the Sunlight and ProPublica style guides (LINK TK).

We're going to make basic charts in Highcharts. If you want to go deep into the API, that's great, but don't do that at the expense of your story. A beautiful chart that doesn't help us understand something is no good. A clunky chart that tells a story -- that is something we can build on.
