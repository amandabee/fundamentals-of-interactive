## Examples of the Form

+ NY Times [print annotation](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/04/15/us/site-of-the-boston-marathon-explosion.html) of the Boston Marathon bombing. The week of the bombing, the Boston Globe had an interactive annotation on their homepage. It has since been taken down. 
+ This [AP Interactive](http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2014/04/14/interactive-the-boston-marathon-bombing/7zaZKLuEh5ooMe9KHoGkyO/story.html) is clunky, but it isn't hard to imagine where hover text would be great.
