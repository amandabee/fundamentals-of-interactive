Fall 2014 Post mortem

From Sisi:
- I had originally planned for each of the four modules to take the same amount of time, with the Charts module getting 1 addition week than the others so I could teach some basic data analysis. I've discovered however, that the Quiz module could take significantly less time than the others, and more time should be allocated to either the Chart module or the Maps module.
