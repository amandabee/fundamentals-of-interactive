# Fall 2014 Post mortem

From Sisi:
- I had originally planned for each of the four modules to take the same amount of time, with the Charts module getting 1 addition week than the others so I could teach some basic data analysis. I've discovered however, that the Quiz module could take significantly less time than the others, and more time should be allocated to either the Chart module or the Maps module.
- A large amount of time was spent helping students understand how they should be using CUNY Digital Storage. I have two thoughts on this:
  - If we want to continue using CUNY Digital Storage, I'd propose considering an out-of-class way to teach this skill to all the students at once.
  - If we're willing to stop using CUNY Digital Storage, I believe we can highly consider moving the students to Github and publishing through Github pages. That way the accounts are theirs forever, and they'd be learning how to use Github as well, which is a must-have skill for anyone who does this type of work in the industry. On top of that, the students get version control for free.
