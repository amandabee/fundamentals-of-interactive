# Fall 2014 Post mortem

To keep the meeting streamlined, I suggest we all post at least one thought on how to improve the 10-week module next fall.

## From Sisi:
- I had originally planned for each of the four modules to take the same amount of time, with the Charts module getting 1 addition week than the others so I could teach some basic data analysis. I've discovered however, that the Quiz module could take significantly less time than the others, and more time should be allocated to either the Chart module or the Maps module.
- A large amount of time was spent helping students understand how they should be using CUNY Digital Storage. I have two thoughts on this:
  - If we want to continue using CUNY Digital Storage, I'd propose considering an out-of-class way to teach this skill to all the students at once.
  - If we're willing to stop using CUNY Digital Storage, I believe we can strongly consider moving the students to Github and publishing through Github pages. That way the accounts are theirs forever, and they'd be learning how to use Github as well, which is a must-have skill for anyone who does this type of work in the industry. On top of that, the students get version control for free. I know Jue was thinking about teaching Github in her labs as well.


## From Russell
- Liki Sisi, I cut the Quiz time significantly, giving more revision and development time for the charts and maps, which were more conceptually and technically challenging for the students. The Quiz, however, was a lot more fun for the class to do, and a nice way to end the semester.
- I agree that CUNY digital storage was a big pain and an unnecessary distraction. Students struggled to simply log on to the system. I found that many used the FTP menu shortcut, Copy > HTTP URL (or something like that), but that actually doesn't give the student the correct path (it leaves out their firstname.lastname directory). It was very confusing for them.
- The carousel template from Bootstrap, as is, isn't that great, and there's some CSS tinkering that needs to be done to make the caption legible. I ended up providing one that I modified. Here's a student example (http://digitalstorage.journalism.cuny.edu/maria.sanchezdiez/public_html/Bedford-Stuyvesant%20Volunteer%20Ambulance/index.html)
- It was a bit odd to teach/evaluate photo skills in the context of our data/interactivity module. Perhaps that won't be an issue the next time around when visuals go wholly into the other program. But then, do we still keep a slideshow project?
- I'd love to see all of your "best of" examples from your students. Here are mine:
- chart (http://digitalstorage.journalism.cuny.edu/jessica.bal/public_html/chartrev/chartrev.html)
- slideshow (http://digitalstorage.journalism.cuny.edu/maria.sanchezdiez/public_html/Bedford-Stuyvesant%20Volunteer%20Ambulance/index.html)
- Quiz (http://digitalstorage.journalism.cuny.edu/catherine.roberts/public_html/fms/Roberts%20Quiz/index.html)
- Map (http://digitalstorage.journalism.cuny.edu/marguerite.ward/public_html/fms/AlcoholRelatedCrashesNY/index.html)

## From Amanda
- I agree that Digital Storage is exasperating. I like the idea of introducing them to github, though we'd have to navigate the whole public/private dilemma. We don't really show them how to make work private on Digital Storage, but it isn't really discoverable. On Github it will be pretty discoverable.
- I wound up stretching the maps and charts out over a longer period -- those needed more time.
- I made the quiz revision extra credit. I felt that their energy was better spent on the charts and maps
- I'm torn about the quiz and slideshow -- the slideshow snuck a lot of HTML in, and both incorporated a good amount of writing for unusual forms -- two important skills. 

From Lam

I'd say the two most useful assignments were the map and the charts. The
slideshow was a good and low-coding level intro do this kind of
storytelling and given that they only get a tiny introduction to
photography a good way to think about how images can be used in interactive
storytelling and made them do 'real people' reporting, something I'm always
a fan of. I would say that the quiz was the least helpful for the students.
It was super easy to implement and not a big reporting challenge.

Last but not least, I did give them a thorough intro to what HTML and CSS
is, gave them a quick rundown of UX design and workflow and they really
appreciated that. While not part of the curriculum it seemed to be
something that was helpful in understanding how all the pieces hang
together (something I actually replicated here in Alaska!).

I'll try to join, but can't guarantee I can make it!
