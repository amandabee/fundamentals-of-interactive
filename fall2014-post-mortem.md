# Fall 2014 Post mortem

From Sisi:
- I had originally planned for each of the four modules to take the same amount of time, with the Charts module getting 1 addition week than the others so I could teach some basic data analysis. I've discovered however, that the Quiz module could take significantly less time than the others, and more time should be allocated to either the Chart module or the Maps module.
- A large amount of time was spent helping students understand how they should be using CUNY Digital Storage. I have two thoughts on this:
  - If we want to continue using CUNY Digital Storage, I'd propose considering an out-of-class way to teach this skill to all the students at once.
  - If we're willing to stop using CUNY Digital Storage, I believe we can strongly consider moving the students to Github and publishing through Github pages. That way the accounts are theirs forever, and they'd be learning how to use Github as well, which is a must-have skill for anyone who does this type of work in the industry. On top of that, the students get version control for free. I know Jue was thinking about teaching Github in her labs as well.


  From Russell
- Liki Sisi, I cut the Quiz time significantly, giving more revision and development time for the charts and maps, which were more conceptually and technically challenging for the students. The Quiz, however, was a lot more fun for the class to do, and a nice way to end the semester.
- I agree that CUNY digital storage was a big pain and an unnecessary distraction. Students struggled to simply log on to the system. I found that many used the FTP menu shortcut, Copy > HTTP URL (or something like that), but that actually doesn't give the student the correct path (it leaves out their firstname.lastname directory). It was very confusing for them.
- The carousel template from Bootstrap, as is, isn't that great, and there's some CSS tinkering that needs to be done to make the caption legible. I ended up providing one that I modified. Here's a student example (http://digitalstorage.journalism.cuny.edu/maria.sanchezdiez/public_html/Bedford-Stuyvesant%20Volunteer%20Ambulance/index.html)
- It was a bit odd to teach/evaluate photo skills in the context of our data/interactivity module. Perhaps that won't be an issue the next time around when visuals go wholly into the other program. But then, do we still keep a slideshow project?
- I'd love to see all of your "best of" examples from your students. Here are mine:
