## Lab


###Clean up Digital Storage 
+  make sure your files are all inside of your "fundamentals" folder in public_html and 
+  make sure they're all named properly (i.e. `map_pitch.html`, `map_draft.html`, `map_final.html`) though you don't have "map_final.html" yet.
+  get rid of files that you uploaded directly to your "public_html" folder.

###Finish your chart draft
+  get it onto an HTML page with a title and a subtitle
+  upload it to digital storage
+  Play around with some of the options at <http://api.highcharts.com> to refine your chart.

###Refine your Slideshow
+  Find the class for  your captions and give them a background color (optional)
+  Proofread your captions. Do they tell a story? Can a person start at the first slide and understand what they're seeing?

###Refine your map
+  Are you using quantiles or equal intervals?
+  Do your info windows make sense?
+  Do your title and sub title guide the reader to a story? What should I take from this map? The title should point me there.
+  Add a paragraph below the map that outlines further reporting you think might be warranted.
