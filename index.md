**Course objectives**  
This ten week module will introduce you to a variety of interactive storytelling forms and will combine storytelling skills, especially creating content appropriate to the form, with fundamental technical skills that will serve as the foundation for your interactive work at the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism.


**Course outcomes**  

We're going to cover four story forms that we think touch on a range of skills you can use throughout your career. Sometimes this class will feel like a whirlwind, and you won't have a chance to perfect every story you produce. That's okay! If you want to build on what you learn this semester, take newsgames or data visualization or take advantage of coaching to incorporate these into your stories in other classes. Students will leave this module with experience:  

+ Writing a basic HTML page
+ Using an FTP client to publish content online
+ Incorporating external javascript libraries to create basic interactions
+ Crafting good questions to ensure they get useful technical assistance when they need it
+ Creating basic maps and charts that convey information clearly
+ Reporting and producing stories with data and interactivity

Students will also have experience telling meaningful and complete stories in interactive formats where space is at a premium.

## Story Guidelines
Your work for this class should be your own original reporting. However, if you've done reporting for another class that you'd like to expand on in an interactive project, we encourage you to return to stories you know well. 

Every story you produce for our class should include clear source information for any data or images that you did not produce yourself. 

### Specific Story Requirements

+ **Slideshow**: your slideshow should include six to ten different images with captions. Each caption should be 20 to 100 words. 
+ **Map**: your map can be a map of points or shapes, but should include a clear, thoughtful title and a caption that tells us why we're looking at this map. Your caption should be between 50 and 150 words. 
+ **Quiz**: your quiz should include four to six questions with two to four possible answers each. 
+ **Chart**: your chart assignment should use data with news interest and inlude a title and caption that direct readers to a clear takeaway (which is to say, they should know why they are looking at this chart)

Remember: titles and captions are part of your story. Work is not complete without them.

## Plagiarism and Copyright

It is a serious ethical violation to take any material created by another person and represent it as your own original work. Any such plagiarism will result in serious disciplinary action, possibly including dismissal from the CUNY J-School. *Plagiarism* may involve copying text from a book or magazine without attributing the source, or lifting words, code, photographs, videos, or other materials from the Internet and attempting to pass them off as your own. Please ask the instructor if you have any questions about how to distinguish between acceptable research and plagiarism.

In addition to being a serious academic issue, *copyright* is a serious legal issue.

Never "lift" or "borrow" or "appropriate" or "repurpose" graphics, audio, or code without both permission and attribution. This guidance applies to scripts, audio, video clips, programs, photos, drawings, and other images, and it includes images found online and in books.

Create your own graphics, seek out images that are in the public domain or shared via a creative commons license that allows derivative works, or use images from the AP Photo Bank or which the school has obtained licensing.

If you’re repurposing code, be sure to keep the original licensing intact. If you’re not sure how to credit code, ask.

The exception to this rule is fair use: if your story is about the image itself, it is often acceptable to reproduce the image. If you want to better understand fair use, the [Citizen Media Law Project](http://www.citmedialaw.org/legal-guide) is an excellent resource. </a>

When in doubt: ask.

## Deadlines

Deadlines are real: we plan lessons around the assumption that you will have pitches to workshop when pitches are due. If you don't, it disrupts the whole class. So deadlines should not be missed without exceptionally good reason, and your instructor should always be notified in advance. 

If you're stumped or stuck or worried that you are falling behind, talk to me. I can help get you caught up and unstuck.

## Absences and Tardiness

Participation and attendance required and are important to your success in the class.

Please be on time for class and back to class from breaks. Repeated tardiness will result in a reduction of grade in participation.
