## For Next Week
+ Slideshow Revisions.  Focus on content, get your pictures resized, make sure you tell a story. Next week we'll work on some CSS. 
+ Chart drafts. I'd like you to get it all the way onto an HTML page, but I'll take a jsFiddle with a solid chart over an HTML page with a nonsense chart.
