## Hands-On
We're going to use Mother Jones' [quiz framework](https://github.com/motherjones/newsquiz) to make a super basic quiz. 

My starting point: <http://digitalstorage.journalism.cuny.edu/amandahickman/newsgames/quiz/>

We're going to play a bit with Tabletop.js -- if you don't know it, [Source has a nice write up](http://source.opennews.org/en-US/articles/ultralight-cmses/) and Mike Ball has [another](http://www.mikeball.us/blog/using-google-spreadsheets-and-tabletop-js-as-a-web-application-back-end)


And we're going to use a little jQuery. We're actually just going to pull in an external js file for jQuery [we're not going to host it ourselves, though](https://encosia.com/3-reasons-why-you-should-let-google-host-jquery-for-you/)


## Exercises
Everyone pick your favorite stat out of [Stats and the City](http://mycrains.crainsnewyork.com/stats-and-the-city/boroughs) and we'll make a quiz about the city.
