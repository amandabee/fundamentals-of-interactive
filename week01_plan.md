# Lesson Plan Week 01

## Welcome, 30 min

Welcome, introductions, syllabus review, expectations. 

[this](http://craft-ii.tumblr.com/post/71316688893/theokbb-zine-shipping-and-boardwalk-empire) is how we consume media today. If you want to reach audiences, knowing this makes a huge difference. 

When big news breaks, newsrooms scramble to tell the story quickly and in engaging formats. Especially as we're making sense of a complicated story, being able to deploy interactive content gives us better stories.

### Story Ideas

Do you have anything in mind already?

## How the Web Works, 25 min

This isn't a course in System Administration so we're going to gloss over a whole lot of things. Bear with me. It will be worth it. 

### Hello World

+ html file extensions
+ Localhost vs. Server

### FTP

+ protocol: SFTP
+ hostname: digitalstorage.journalism.cuny.edu
+ username: amanda.hickman *your network username*
+ password: `********` *your network password*

Everyone upload your hello world page, look at it in a browser. Compare the URLs.

### Get Organized

Make a folder, fall2014-fundamentals, on the server. That is where your work is going to go this semester. If you're smart, you'll mirror that on your laptop, but that's up to you. 

## Bootstrap 101, 45 minutes

There are a lot of ways you can customize HTML pages, but we want to tear through a ton of fun and interesting things this semester, so we're going to work with some super limited templates.
