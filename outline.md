## Slideshow
### Pitch Week 1, Due Week 3

+ Graphic slide set from Boston Marathon bombing. No captions. [View](http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/specials/boston-marathon-explosions)
+ [Obesity in China](http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2014/07/18/world/asia/20140718_obese_now.html) chosen more or less at random from NY Times. 
+ More complex [timeline based slide show from ABC](http://abcnews.go.com/US/fullpage/boston-marathon-bombing-interactive-timeline-abcnews-189975400)
+ Slightly wonky Detroit Free Press [interactive](http://www.freep.com/interactive/article/20130415/NEWS07/304150201/boston-marathon-bombing-map) on the bombing.
+ Not in a true "slideshow" format, but NPR's [2013 Best Music](http://www.npr.org/blogs/bestmusic2013/2013/12/10/249243871/npr-musics-50-favorite-albums-of-2013) roundup follows the basic format of a good slideshow. 
+ Not a true "slideshow" but a photo driven story that could easily be a slideshow.[Life below the poverty line in Troy, NY] (http://www.slate.com/blogs/behold/2014/07/17/brenda_ann_kenneally_documents_life_below_the_poverty_line_in_troy_york.html)
+ (http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/may/26/firestorm-bushfire-dunalley-holmes-family)

## Image Map/Annotation
### Pitch Week 2, Due Week 4

+ NY Times [print annotation](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/04/15/us/site-of-the-boston-marathon-explosion.html) of the Boston Marathon bombing. The week of the bombing, the Boston Globe had an interactive annotation on their homepage. It has since been taken down. 
+ This [AP Interactive](http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2014/04/14/interactive-the-boston-marathon-bombing/7zaZKLuEh5ooMe9KHoGkyO/story.html) is clunky, but it isn't hard to imagine where hover text would be great. 


## Map
### Pitch Week 3, Due Week 5

+ WNYC [Sandy Flooding](http://project.wnyc.org/flooding-sandy-new/#12.00/40.7378/-74.07020)
+ ProPublica [Government Lends to Rebuild in Flood Zones](http://projects.propublica.org/sandy-sba/)

## Quiz
### Pitch Week 4, Due Week 6
## Chart
### Pitch Week 5, Due Week 7

+ WAMU [In Fight For Deals, Developers Make Well-Timed Campaign Contributions ](http://wamu.org/news/13/05/23/timing_of_campaign_contributions_examined) -- not chart driven, but the chart is a nice example of a simple, clean chart that helps tell the story.
+ Miami Herald [Tracking the Hunger Strike](http://www.miamiherald.com/static/media/projects/gitmo_chart/) is an example of a more advanced chart-based story. 
+ NPR [Zoom In On Oklahoma Tornado Damage](http://apps.npr.org/moore-oklahoma-tornado-damage/)
