*Start a class wiki on GitHub with examples of each story form that we'll cover. Invite students to add their own examples and to look ahead and be thinking about what they want to do for stories.* 

# Story Guidelines
Your work for this class should be your own original reporting. However, if you've done reporting for another class that you'd like to expand on in an interactive project, we encourage you to return to stories you know well. 

We're going to cover five forms that we think touch on a range of skills you can use throughout your career. If you want to build on these, take newsgames or data visualization or take advantage of coaching to incorporate these into your stories in other classes.

# Software Requirements
+ Filezilla
+ TextWrangler
+ Mou

# Online Accounts
+ GIS.stackexchange.com
+ CartoDB (make sure you are getting a  discounted academic account. The regular free account IS NOT ADEQUATE.)
+ JSFiddle
+ GitHub


# Additional Course Goals

Students need the skills to put their portfolios together. Can we get Career Svcs or an IT Brownbag for this? 

# Week by Week
## Week 0

Before class ... please come week 1 with Filezilla, TextWrangler and Mou installed on your computer. All three are available free of charge.
