Folks,

I'm looking forward to hitting the ground running with our 10 week data module tomorrow. My syllabus, and most of the material's you'll need for class live at:

<http://amandabee.github.io/fundamentals-of-interactive/>

Before we meet, please take a moment to install ...

+ [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/)
+ [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/) 
+ [Mou](http://25.io/mou/) 

...on your laptop. We'll be using all three in class on Thursday. They're all available free of charge. 

I also suggest that you read <http://www.niemanlab.org/2013/12/scooped-by-code/> to give some context to the next ten weeks. 

See you Thursday!
Amanda
